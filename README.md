# Pog
Pog can observe your location regardless of application state (foreground/background/not-running)


## Demo

- You can check your place-log even though you do not keep this app on foreground / background (suspended / not running state is Okay).

## Notation

To observe location change while your app is killed (not running), you have to grant **Always-LocationAuthorization** from `Settings`.
